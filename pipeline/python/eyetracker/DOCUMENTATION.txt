1. User defined bounding boxes for pupil and corneal reflection, separately.

from command line, run: eyetracker/get_user_roi.py (e.g.: python eyetracker/get_user_roi.py -i CE074 -S 20180213 -A FOV1_zoom1x -r blobs)

	-GUI Instructions (Also available from terminal)
 	1) Click and drag box around pupil. 
	1b) To record pupil bounding box, press 'p'. Otherwise, repeat step 1 to define a new box (record of old one will be erased)
	2) Select pupil threshold
	2b) Increase/Decrease threshold with ‘w’ and ’s’ keys, respectively. Press ‘p’ to record threshold
		*try to find a threshold that comfortably fits outline of pupil
	3) Click and drag box around corneal reflection 
	3b) To record corneal reflection bounding box, press 'c'. Otherwise, repeat step 3 to define a new box (record of old one will be erased)
	4) Select corneal reflection threshold
	4b) Increase/Decrease threshold with ‘w’ and ’s’ keys, respectively. Press ‘c’ to record threshold
		*try to find a threshold that comfortably fits outline of corneal reflection
	Bounding boxes + threshold will be saved at the end


2.process eyetracker data

python eyetracker/process_eyetracker_data.py -i CE074 -S 20180213 -A FOV1_zoom1x -r blobs
